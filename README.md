# Dynamic Chat
## When you execute .jar file, enter this ip address to allow you to have multiple users in chatroom
## IP Address: 34.41.183.198
## In the chatroom, I implementated engaging features like "/flip" for coin toss simulations and "/roll number" for dice rolling a randomly generated dice between the size of 0 and the number you choose
## You can unmute/mute users by saying /muute User1 or /unmute User1. Muting(/mute 1) will prevent User1 from seeing your message
## When you do **your message**, it will bold your message, --message-- will italize your message, and __message__  will underline your message
